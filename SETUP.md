## Setting Up a FastAPI Service for Trip Information

This guide outlines how to set up a FastAPI service that provides information about trips, including details such as station codes, miles, time, and fares. The service uses SQLAlchemy with async support for database interactions and aiofiles for asynchronous file operations.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or newer
- FastAPI version 0.101.0 or newer
- SQLAlchemy with async support (aiosqlite) version 0.17.0 or newer
- aiofiles for asynchronous file operations version 23.1.0 or newer
- A JSON file (`fares.json`) containing initial fare data (included)

### Database Setup

1. **Database Engine and Session**: The service uses an async engine with SQLite. The `create_async_engine` function from `sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio` is used to create the engine, and an async session creator is defined using `sessionmaker`.

2. **ORM Models**: SQLAlchemy ORM is used for defining the `TripInfo` model. This model maps to the `trips` table in the SQLite database.

3. **Database Initialization**: An asynchronous function `create_tables` is defined to create the tables based on the ORM model.

### FastAPI Application Setup

1. **Application Instance**: An instance of `FastAPI` is created.

2. **Startup Event**: A startup event handler is set to run the `create_tables` function, ensuring the database tables are created when the application starts.

3. **Data Loading**: At startup, fare data is loaded asynchronously from `fares.json` into a global variable `fares_data`.

4. **API Endpoints**:
   - A root endpoint (`/`) is defined to serve fare data.
   - The endpoint supports query parameters for `FromStationCode` and `ToStationCode`.
   - Input validation is performed using regular expressions to ensure station codes follow a specific pattern.

5. **Response Formatting**: The `TripInfo` model includes methods `to_json` and `to_xml` for formatting responses. Currently, the XML formatting is not implemented (`XML_TEMPLATE` is not defined).

### Running the Application

- Run the application using a command like `uvicorn filename:app`, where `filename` is the name of the Python file containing the FastAPI application.

### Notes

- Ensure the `fares.json` file is in the correct format and located in the same directory as the FastAPI application file.
- This guide assumes familiarity with Python, FastAPI, and SQLAlchemy.
- For production deployment, consider additional aspects like security, error handling, and environment configuration.
